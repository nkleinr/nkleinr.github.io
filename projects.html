      <h3>Coding</h3>
      <p>I enjoy learning new languages and processes when it comes to coding and software development. 
        It’s exciting to see how each new language or framework opens up different ways to solve problems. 
        Coding also gives me the opportunity to be creative while building practical solutions that can help people.</p>

      <h3>Sports</h3>
      <p>I love following the Detroit sports teams including the Detroit Pistons and the Detroit Lions.
      I played Basketball and Football growing up and had a lot of fun.
      Watching games now brings back those memories, and it’s even better when I get to share the experience with friends and family.
      Supporting Detroit teams also gives me a strong sense of pride and connection to the community.</p>

      <h3>Video Games</h3>
      <p>I love playing video games online with my friends. My favorite games to play are World of Warcraft, League of Legends, and Path of Exile. 
      Gaming gives me a chance to relax while still staying connected with people I care about.
      I also enjoy the challenge of improving my skills and working as a team to overcome tough obstacles.</p>
